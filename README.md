# Data Science and Machine Learning Portfolio

Repository containing portfolio of data science projects completed for academic, self learning, and professional purposes. Presented in the form of Jupyter Notebooks.

Tools :
* Python : NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, OpenCv, etc.
* Machine Learning : Scikit-learn, Tensorflow, Keras

## CONTENTS

* Machine Learning  
  * [Ammo Quality Control](https://github.com/ronnymunthe99/Portfolio_Data_Science/blob/main/Ammo_QC.ipynb) : A collaboration project between Diponegoro University and PT PIndad to detect bullet damages classified into four categories: critical, major, minor, and good. Due to confidentiality reasons, I cannot share too much information about this project.
  * [SiAladin](http://aladin-alor.com/) : A collaborative project between Diponegoro University and the Alor District Tourism Department to monitor real-time marine parameters such as temperature, tides, and salinity, which can ultimately predict Alor's ALaDin events based on the collected data. In this project, [image segmentation](https://github.com/ronnymunthe99/RemoteSensing) is performed to detect upwelling areas.
  * [Surgical Skill Assessment](https://github.com/ronnymunthe99/Portfolio_Data_Science/tree/main/Surgical_Skill_Assessment) : A project A project to classify surgical skills videos using two architectures, namely [CNN-LSTM](https://github.com/ronnymunthe99/Portfolio_Data_Science/tree/main/Surgical_Skill_Assessment/CNN-LSTM) and [CNN-GRU](https://github.com/ronnymunthe99/Portfolio_Data_Science/tree/main/Surgical_Skill_Assessment/CNN-GRU), consisting of three skills: knot-tying, suturing, and needle-passing. Each skill is classified into three assessment categories: Novice (V), Intermediate (I), and Expert.
  * [Fraud Detection](https://github.com/ronnymunthe99/Portfolio_Data_Science/blob/main/Fraud%20Detection.ipynb) : Using Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to obtain initial information from the data, undersampling to balance the unbalanced data, and Random Forest for fraud detection

* Data analysis dan visualization or Computer Vision (Python)
  * [Customer Segementation](https://github.com/ronnymunthe99/Portfolio_Data_Science/blob/main/kmeans-clustering-in-customer-segmentation.ipynb) : Using [Kmeans](https://github.com/ronnymunthe99/Portfolio_Data_Science/blob/main/kmeans-clustering-in-customer-segmentation.ipynb) and [Agglomeratice Clustering](https://github.com/ronnymunthe99/Portfolio_Data_Science/blob/main/hierarchical-agglomerative-clustering.ipynb) 
  * [Image Processing](https://github.com/ronnymunthe99/Portfolio_Data_Science/blob/main/RGB%20(2).ipynb) : Using OpenCV for image processing tasks such as cropping and resizing, and extracting RGB array data and saving it to an Excel file.

* Minor Projects
  * [Machine Learning - PCA](https://github.com/ronnymunthe99/Portfolio_Data_Science/blob/main/Machine%20Learning-PCA.ipynb)
  * [Prediction the Price](https://github.com/ronnymunthe99/Portfolio_Data_Science/blob/main/Predicts_the_Price_of_Red_Cayenne_Use_LSTM_and_GRU%20(1).ipynb)
  * [Kaggle Titanic](https://github.com/ronnymunthe99/Portfolio_Data_Science/blob/main/Practice_1_Structured_Dataset_Plotting_Supervised_(1).ipynb)
  * [Regresi](https://github.com/ronnymunthe99/Portfolio_Data_Science/blob/main/Regresi.ipynb)
  * [Python For Data Science](https://github.com/ronnymunthe99/PythonForDataScience)
  * [Calculate Manually CNN-GRU Architecture using Excel](https://github.com/ronnymunthe99/CalculateManuallyCNN-RNNArchitecture)
